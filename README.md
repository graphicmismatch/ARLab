# ARLab: AR/VR Laboratory Simulation

ARLab is a Unity project aimed at creating an immersive laboratory simulation experience using augmented reality (AR). This project utilizes Manomotion's skeleton hand tracking to enable realistic hand interactions within the virtual environment on your mobile using a hybrid interface.

## Features
- Augmented laboratory environment with interactive elements.
- Skeleton hand tracking for precise hand interactions.
- A hybrid user interaction model using UI in both virtual and static scopes.
- Safety protocols and ethical guidelines integrated into simulations.
- [User Interaction and Feature Case Study](https://www.figma.com/file/wkA369YlD60cHgtbznRgNK/ARLab?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=bKASUBZ8B3gNZZ8d-1)

## Requirements
- Android 9.0 or later
- Google ARcore Support

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the ARLab project repository.
2. Open the project in Unity.
3. Compile the project to your android device using a USB.
4. Run the ARLan application and proceed to interact with the virtual lab.

## Usage
- Upon launching the ARLab application, users can login and access the particular subject and experiments they would like to practice.
- Users can use hand gestures tracked by Manomotion to interact with laboratory equipment and perform experiments.
- Experiment results and observations can be recorded and analyzed within the virtual environment.
- Users can hence make note of the procedure and practice the experiments in a safe environment.
